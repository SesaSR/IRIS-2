Task 3 - IRIS FLOWER CLASSIFICATION:  Develop a model that can classify iris flowers into different species based on their sepal and petal measurements.
 
Task 4 - SALES PREDICTION USING PYTHON: Utilize machine learning techniques in Python to analyze and interpret data, so that one can make informed decisions regarding advertising costs. 
                                        By leveraging these predictions, businesses can optimize their advertising strategies and maximize sales potential.

Task 5 - CREDIT CARD FRAUD DETECTION: Preprocess and normalize the transaction data, handle class imbalance issues, and split the dataset into training and testing sets.
                                      Train a classification algorithm, such as logistic regression or random forests, to classify transactions as fraudulent or genuine.
                                      Evaluate the model's performance using metrics like precision, recall, and F1-score, and consider techniques like oversampling or
                                      undersampling for improving results.
